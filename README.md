# Dockerfiles

Between fun and work, these are some dockerfiles I have built.

**Some usefull images for work:**

For workshop purpouses, we needed pre-configured desktop environment sandboxes.
Looking for examples I have found:
[SvenDowideit](https://github.com/SvenDowideit)
(thanks!)

Almost cloning his work, I have customized some remote accesible environments:

[debian-xrdp](xrdp/base/xrdp-debian/Dockerfile)
[debian-xrdp-mate](xrdp/base/xrdp-debian-mate/Dockerfile)

Just as an example of environment:

[xrdp-eclipse-java-ee](xrdp/eclipse/xrdp-eclipse-java-ee/Dockerfile)


**And for fun,**

Some g-wan testing. A small image based on
[jeanblanchard](https://github.com/jeanblanchard)
[jeanblanchard/alpine-glibc](https://hub.docker.com/r/jeanblanchard/alpine-glibc/)

[alpine-gwan](gwan/alpine-gwan/Dockerfile)
